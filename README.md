# BankChurnPrediction

ðŸ’» In this project, our focus centered on bank churn prediction, employing two robust classification algorithms: Decision Tree Classifier and Random Forest Classifier ðŸ¤–.

ðŸ’¡ðŸ“ˆ To enhance the efficiency of these models, we embraced hyperparameter tuning via Grid Search CV. This systematic approach meticulously explored the optimal combination of hyperparametersâ€”such as maximum depth, minimum sample split, and the number of estimatorsâ€”aiming to elevate the models' performance ðŸ“š.

ðŸŒŸðŸš€ Following hyperparameter tuning, we meticulously assessed the models' performance using diverse classification metrics. These metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, offered nuanced insights into the models' precision in classifying churned and non-churned bank customers ðŸŽ¯.

ðŸ“ˆðŸ“‰ Furthermore, we leveraged the AUC-ROC (Area Under the Curve - Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve to gauge the overall effectiveness of the models. This graphical representation, plotting true positive rate against false positive rate, yielded a comprehensive measure of the models' predictive prowess. A higher AUC-ROC score signaled superior discrimination and predictive capabilities ðŸ”¬ðŸ“Š.
